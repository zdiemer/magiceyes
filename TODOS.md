# magiceyes — TODOs

Status: Wiz support verified end-to-end (Deicide 3 commercial + Cave Story). Now
generalizing to the whole Game Park Holdings family + hardening for spin-out into
its own repo.

## In progress

### GP2X F100/F200 needs syscall-level emulation (Unicorn backend or qemu patch)
FINDING (confirmed): GP2X `.gpe` are **GPEComp** self-extractors (rlyeh, UCL) — the
tiny stub links libc, decompresses the real game to `/mnt/tmp/<name>_tmp`, and execs
it. The **real decompressed binary is FULLY STATICALLY LINKED** (Payback: static 10MB
EABI; Knight Lore same). A static binary makes **raw `svc` syscalls** with no dynamic
linker — so **`LD_PRELOAD` interception is impossible** (can't hook libSDL *or* libc).
magiceyes' entire current approach (replace the dynamic `libSDL`) therefore CANNOT
run GP2X games. (The Wiz worked only because its commercial titles dynamically linked
`libSDL`.)

Two ways to intercept a static binary's `/dev/fb0` + `/dev/mem` (MMSP2) + `/dev/gpio`
+ `/dev/dsp` at the **syscall** layer:
- **Unicorn backend (recommended):** the roadmap host/ engine (Unicorn ARM CPU + our
  own ELF loader + Linux-syscall shim). We own every syscall, so we fake GP2X hardware
  for ANY binary, static or dynamic — and it's the same work that delivers the native
  cross-platform binary. **GP2X support and cross-platform converge here.** Also lets
  us un-GPEComp in-process (no `/mnt/tmp`+exec dance).
- **Patch qemu-user:** ~a few hundred lines in qemu's `do_openat`/`do_mmap`/`do_ioctl`
  to special-case the GP2X device paths/addresses → our shm framebuffer. Faster but
  Linux-only and ships a forked qemu.

Other GP2X notes (still relevant once syscalls are owned):
- GPEComp: offline **un-GPEComp tool** in tools/ (UCL decompress) so we get the raw
  binary without runtime `/mnt/tmp`. Must run from **ext4** (drvfs breaks the stub's
  self-`stat`); needs writable `/mnt/tmp` if run live.
- Emulate MMSP2: framebuffer base/flip/mode regs + the 2D **blitter** (the hard part);
  use the staged firmware source + paeryn SDL source for the register map.
  - `/dev/fb0` → a RAM framebuffer; on flip, present via the shm→viewer (reuse the
    existing viewer + shm contract).
  - `/dev/mem` @ phys `0xC0000000` → fake MMSP2 register page (fb base/flip/mode +
    the 2D blitter). No GP2X kernel source is public; map regs from the staged
    firmware source + paeryn SDL source.
  - `/dev/gpio` (buttons ← shm), `/dev/dsp`/`/dev/mixer` (audio → shm ring).

Once syscalls are owned, the per-device **profile** = {rootfs, button map, SoC:
MMSP2 vs Pollux}. ABI is EABI on both. Reuse the Wiz rootfs for EABI GP2X games;
GP2X-specific libs (`libmedia`, etc.) come from the F100/F200 firmware patch tar.
- 940T co-CPU: some GP2X games offload audio to the ARM940 via `/dev/mem` mailbox;
  likely unsupported (flag per-title).
- **Caanoo** (Pollux, like Wiz): once the shim handles Pollux too, mostly mirrors Wiz
  + its own rootfs/button map (analog stick).

### Wiz raw arcade ports (Out Zone/Deicide arcade `.gpe`)
Same root cause as GP2X — they bypass SDL and poke MMSP2 directly. The MMSP2 shim
above is the fix; until then, unsupported (the SDL-replacement only covers
dynamic-libSDL titles like Deicide 3 itself + Cave Story).

## Backlog

### rootfs extraction helper
`tools/extract_rootfs.sh`: firmware zip/image → a `MAGICEYES_ROOTFS` tree
(Wiz: ubifs via `ubireader`; GP2X: cramfs/ext2 — TBD from firmware layout).
Plus a README "from firmware to rootfs" section so it's not tribal knowledge.

### Consolidate debug switches
Fold the env-gated probes in `fakesdl.c` (`FAKESDL_BLIT_LOG`, `FAKESDL_SRC_DUMP`,
`FAKESDL_DISPFMT`/DISPFMT log, `FAKESDL_NO_COLORKEY`, `FAKESDL_AUDIO_TEST/DUMP`)
into one `MAGICEYES_DEBUG=blit,audio,src,...` switch; keep them, just tidy.

### romnas wiring
Point `gp2x-wiz` (then `gp2x`, `gp2x-caanoo`) at magiceyes in
`config/emulators.yaml` + `config/systems.yaml`: launcher invokes `magiceyes.sh`,
`frontend_entrypoint: *.gpe`, and a `.dat`-extraction post_process (Deicide etc.)
modeled on the existing extract/decrypt steps. Linux/WSL2 only (note in profile).

### Unicorn native backend (true cross-platform binary)
Replace qemu-user with a portable ARM CPU emulator (Unicorn Engine) + a small ELF
loader + Linux-syscall shim, so magiceyes ships as a native Windows/macOS/Linux
binary with no VM. Guest side is untouched (it already owns the SDL/audio/DRM
surface, so the remaining syscall surface is modest: file I/O, mmap, ioctl, time,
shm). Lives under `host/` next to the qemu backend.

### Packaging / distribution
Per-OS bundles: Linux AppImage (qemu-arm-static + rootfs + guest libs + viewer);
Windows WSL2 installer; macOS via container. Single `magiceyes` entrypoint that
picks the backend. (Spin into its own repo around here.)

### Audio: per-title robustness
Pre-buffer + closed-loop pump verified on Wiz; re-check on GP2X titles (different
SDL build / rates). The viewer pull-callback could move to `SDL_QueueAudio` (push)
if any host's audio stack fights the callback.
